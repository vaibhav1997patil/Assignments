function average(a, b) {
    return a + b / 2;
    }
    // The function calculates the average of the two numbers by adding them together and dividing the sum by 2. 
    console.log(average(2, 1)); // in this way the output will br 2.5

    // But the correct way to calculate the correct average is by using () parentheses on operation of addition i.e.(a+b)/2  and output will be 1.5 which is correct
